# GCP Service Account Creation Role Binding and Secret Generation for PoLP Impersonation

<br>

Welcome to the GCP Service Account Creation Role Binding and Secret Generation for PoLP Impersonation
 toolkit â€“ a suite of scripts designed for automating the creation, verification, and cleanup of roles, service accounts, and secrets on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This toolkit epitomizes the principles of streamlined operations and effective permissions management, making it easier to implement the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) and maintain a secure and organized GCP environment.


## Overview

These scripts serve a pivotal role in ensuring efficient and consistent configurations across your GCP deployments:

1. **u_backup_iam_policy.sh**: This script safeguards your configurations by capturing and storing a snapshot of your current GCP project's IAM policy.

2. **u_sa_role_create_bind.sh**: This script provides the backbone for initial setup, automating the creation of custom IAM roles, service accounts, their respective bindings, and secrets.
  
3. **u_verify_environment.sh**: Think of this as a diagnostic tool; it cross-references the environment's configurations against the ones specified in your `.env` file to ensure everything's set up correctly.

4. **u_clean_environment.sh**: When you need to reset or tear down configurations, this script steps in to unbind roles, delete service accounts, and remove secrets.

Accompanying these scripts, the `.env` files act as the heart of configuration, containing the necessary directives that guide the scripts in their operations. In combination with the `role.json` files, they allow for a highly modular setup where specific roles with distinct permissions can be curated, providing a flexible, secure, and efficient IAM management system.

For a closer look at how each script functions and how you can maximize their potential, dive into the sections below.

## Pre-requisites

Before utilizing the scripts in this toolkit, please ensure the following:

1. **Google Cloud SDK**: You should have the Google Cloud SDK installed on your machine. This includes the `gcloud` command-line tool, which is used by the scripts to interact with GCP.

2. **Authenticated User**: Make sure you're authenticated to the right GCP account and have set the desired project. You can check your currently authenticated account with `gcloud auth list` and your current project with `gcloud config get-value project`.

3. **Permissions**: Your authenticated account must have sufficient permissions to create and manage IAM roles, service accounts, and secrets in the specified GCP project. 

4. **.env Files**: Prepare your `.env` files with the necessary configurations for the scripts. The scripts will prompt you for the path to these files when they run.

5. **role.json Files**: Ensure that the role definition files (`role.json`) are correctly set up in the specified paths in your `.env` files. These files define the custom roles the scripts will create.

6. **Backup**: Before making changes, especially on a production environment, it's a good practice to backup your current IAM settings. This can be done using the `u_backup_iam_policy.sh` script. It will capture and store a snapshot of your current GCP project's IAM policy.

7. **Safety First**: Always review any script, especially those that make changes to permissions and resources, before executing them. Understand each step it takes and confirm that its actions align with your desired configurations and best practices.
